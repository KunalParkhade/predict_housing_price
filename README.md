## Introduction
In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict housing prices using a dataset containing various features of houses and their surrounding areas. The goal was to build a robust model that can accurately estimate prices, assisting stakeholders in making informed decisions in the real estate market.

## Data Exploration
We explored the dataset to understand the distributions, correlations, and potential anomalies. Key steps included:
- Visualizing data using histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
- Handling missing values with imputation techniques.
- Engineering new features such as attribute ratios and log transformations.

## Model Development
We experimented with various models and preprocessing pipelines to identify the best approach. This involved:
- Creating preprocessing pipelines for numeric and categorical features.
- Testing models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Performing extensive hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Results
The final model achieved the following performance metrics:
- **Validation RMSE**: X
- **Test RMSE**: Y
- **Feature Importance**: Median income was the most significant predictor of housing prices.

## Conclusions
Key takeaways from this project include:
- The importance of feature engineering for improving model performance.
- The necessity of proper model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
- Assumptions made about feature relationships and potential limitations.
- Future work could involve more advanced techniques like ensemble learning and deep learning.

## Deployment
The model has been polished, documented, and tested. It was saved using the `joblib` library and deployed to the production environment. Continuous monitoring and updates are planned to maintain accuracy.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KunalParkhade/predict_housing_price.git
    cd predict_housing_price
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To use the model for predicting housing prices, run the following command:
```bash
python predict.py --input data/input_data.csv --output results/predictions.csv
```

Replace data/input_data.csv with the path to your input data file and results/predictions.csv with the desired output file path.
