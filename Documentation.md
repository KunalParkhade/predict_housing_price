#### Title
**Housing Price Prediction Model**

#### Introduction
In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features of houses and their surrounding areas. The goal was to build a robust model that accurately estimates prices, helping stakeholders make informed decisions in the real estate market.

#### Data Exploration
We started by exploring the dataset to understand the distributions, correlations, and potential anomalies. Key steps included:

- **Visualizing Data**: Used histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to visualize the distribution of features and target variable.
- **Missing Values**: Identified and handled missing values using imputation techniques such as filling with the median.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features such as the ratio of certain attributes and log transformations to improve model performance.

#### Model Development
We experimented with various machine learning models and preprocessing pipelines to identify the best approach. Key steps included:

1. **Pipeline Creation**:
   - **Ratio Pipeline**:
     ```python
     def ratio_pipeline():
         return make_pipeline(
             SimpleImputer(strategy="median"),
             FunctionTransformer(column_ratio, feature_names_out=ratio_name),
             StandardScaler()
         )
     ```
   - **Log Pipeline**:
     ```python
     log_pipeline = make_pipeline(
         SimpleImputer(strategy="median"),
         FunctionTransformer(np.log, feature_names_out="one-to-one"),
         StandardScaler()
     )
     ```
   - **Cluster Similarity**:
     ```python
     cluster_simil = ClusterSimilarity(n_clusters=10, gamma=1., random_state=42)
     ```

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Tested various models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Used cross-validation to evaluate model performance and avoid overfitting.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Performed extensive hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
   - Selected the model with the best performance on the validation set.

#### Results
The final model achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of X on the validation set and Y on the test set. The performance metrics indicated that the model was well-generalized and capable of making accurate predictions.

- **Validation RMSE**: X
- **Test RMSE**: Y
- **Feature Importance**: Median income was identified as the most significant predictor of housing prices.

#### Conclusions
Through this project, I learned that:

- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features significantly improved model performance.
- **Model Selection and Tuning**: Proper model selection and hyperparameter tuning are crucial for achieving high accuracy.
- **Assumptions**: Assumed linear relationships between some features and the target variable, which might not always hold true.
- **Limitations**: The model's performance might degrade on entirely new data due to potential overfitting on the validation set.

The project was successful in developing a robust housing price prediction model. Future work could include incorporating more advanced techniques such as ensemble learning and deep learning models to further improve accuracy.

#### Deployment and Maintenance
After getting approval to launch, we polished the code, wrote documentation, and created tests. The final model was saved using the `joblib` library and transferred to the production environment. We plan to continuously monitor the model's performance and update it as necessary to maintain accuracy.
